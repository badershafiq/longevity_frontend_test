## Folowing are my answers to the frontend task questions:

# intime.digital

In Navbar the paragraph under the logo should be on its right side, that way the navbar could be a bit shorter like it is when it gets sticky.

The main Hero image of "Young Female Doctor Looking" is squeezing on smaller screen and not fully responsive. It is a bit annoying and doesn't look pleasant.

Life Expectancy Chart text should be bolder like a heading.

The Life expentency graph is not properly visible in smaller screen size.

# Longevityscientificresort.com

The main heading at the page is not responsive it becomes quite large and overlaps with other elements.

# Longevitycoin.org

In the About section there is no padding in the heading of that section.

The description text About section shoud be align justified.

The icons in the Resort section are too small not clearly visible.

In the Team section there is no padding in the All members button.

The heading at top of the links should be bolder.

At the bottom of the page there is a separator overlating with the Follow us button.

# Implement different image carousals

image_carousal.html file contains the code for this task.
